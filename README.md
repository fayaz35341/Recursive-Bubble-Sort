Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in non-decreasing order using the recursive Bubble Sort algorithm, and return the sorted array.

You must implement Bubble Sort using recursion only.
Do not use built-in sorting functions (sort, sorted, Arrays.sort, etc.).
A sorted array in non-decreasing order is an array where each element is greater than or equal to the previous one.

Example 1

Input: nums = [7, 4, 1, 5, 3]

Output: [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]

Explanation: 1 <= 3 <= 4 <= 5 <= 7.

Thus the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Example 2

Input: nums = [5, 4, 4, 1, 1]

Output: [1, 1, 4, 4, 5]

Explanation: 1 <= 1 <= 4 <= 4 <= 5.

Thus the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Now your turn!

Input: nums = [3, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output:

Pick your answer


[2, 4, 3, 4, 5]

[2, 3, 3, 4, 5]

[5, 4, 3, 3, 2]

[2, 3, 3, 5, 6]
Constraints

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums[i] may contain duplicate values.
